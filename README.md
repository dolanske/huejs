# hue 0.0.4

Tired of vue and react? Well now you can be tired of both of them at the same time!

I present you hue. This is a hobby project where I create my own javascript framework and pack it up with cool features. It takes inspiration from both Vue3 and React, but mainly from Vue because that's a framework I've been working in for over year and I absolutely adore it. My end goal is to create a working framework with router, state management and CSS completely generated with javasript.

## Planned features

- Simple router implementation, allowing to go back & forward. Should support query and hash parameters.
- Simple State management (inspired by planned Vuex5 or Pinia)
- Simplify component creation with a built in compiler to support writing fully functional components (inspired by react or _<script setup>_)
- CSS in JS per component & global implementation
- Make it actually functional
- Component lifecycle hooks (probably will need compiler for this step)

## Goal

My ultimate goal is to create a working, dependency free framework and then write a different project using it. Currently I am thinking of rewriting my project 'Dogsitter' which _sits_ on a backburner at the moment.
