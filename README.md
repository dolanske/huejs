# hue 0.0.8

Tired of vue and react? Well now you can be tired of both of them at the same time!

I present you hue. This is a hobby project where I create my own javascript framework and pack it up with cool features. It takes inspiration from both Vue3 and React, but mainly from Vue because that's a framework I've been working in for over year and I absolutely adore it. My end goal is to create a working framework with router, state management and CSS completely generated with javasript.

## Planned features

- SCSS in javascript compiler, support for inline styling, scoped modules. With mixins, nesting and most basic features
- SPA routing with support for props, hash & query string
- Simple global state management
- Completely written in typescript (gotta learn it first)
- Simple lifecycle hooks (only those which are possible without compiler)

## Stretch goals

- Write actual documentation, clean up code & make framework actually somewhat usable
- Template compiler, some blend of JSX & vue syntax
- Fully fleshed out reactivity, support for watch and computed functions (this step may require compiler and so it isn't in the scope for 0.1.0)
