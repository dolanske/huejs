# hue.js 0.0.8

Tired of vue and react? Well now you can be tired of both of them at the same time!

I present you hue.js; This is a hobby project in which I aim to create a simple front-end javascript framework which handles everything from reactivity, components and routing to state management and the ability to write SCSS. All within my beloved javascript. The main goal I have in mind with this project is to keep learning new things and staying in touch with the ever-evolving world of front-end development.

Huge props to Evan Uou and the whole vue.js team for inspiring me to create my own framework. These guys rock and I love what they are working on. I hope in the future I can create something that could compare to one of these awesome projects.

NOTE: This framework is a passion project and is not intended for commercial use. But I encourage you to try it out and please, PLEASE report any issue or suggestion you might have. I am trying to learn and your feedback means the world to me. Thank you.

## Planned features

- SCSS in javascript which compiles to raw css, support for nesting, mixins, variables, scoped modules and as many quality of life features I can come up with
- SPA routing with support for props, hash & query string
- Simple global state management
- Completely written in typescript (gotta learn it first)
- Simple lifecycle hooks (only those which are possible without compiler)

## Stretch goals

- Write actual documentation, clean up code & make framework actually somewhat usable
- Template compiler, some blend of JSX & vue syntax
- Fully fleshed out reactivity, support for watch and computed functions (this step may require compiler and so it isn't in the scope for 0.1.0)
